# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Here, I am working on detecting Credit Card Fraud based on the dataset from kaggle.com.
It does contain PCA transformation of the original data due to confidentiality issues.
Only Time and Amount are the only untransformed features in the datasets except Features V1, V2, V3,....V28.
Class 0 represent nonfradulent and Class 1 implies fraud in the transaction.
