# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
In this project I'm working on detecting credit card frauds based on the dataset from kaggle.com.
It contains PCA transformation of the original data due to confidentiality issues.
Time and amount are the only untransformed features in the datasets except features V1, V2, V3,....V28.
Class 0 represents nonfradulent and Class 1 implies fraud in the transaction.
